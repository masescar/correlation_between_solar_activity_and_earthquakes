# correlation_between_solar_activity_and_earthquakes
I have created a repository where I display the code I used to study the feasibility of the correlation between solar activity and the existence of earthquakes. 

To handle earthquake data, it has been suggested to group main earthquakes and their respective seismic aftershocks using a DBSCAN algorithm, in addition to proposing a method to exclude tectonic earthquakes based on their proximity to tectonic plates. 

For processing solar data provided by ACE, a NaN imputation using a first-order spline has been proposed. 

The data spans from January 1998 to June 2021.

Due to the excessively large size of the files, which GitHub does not support, I have decided to upload my dataframes to my Kaggle account: https://www.kaggle.com/masescar/datasets
